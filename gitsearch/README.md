DEPENDENCY: This project was created using Node version 18.16.0 (LTS). If any issues arrive with download, try upgrading to this version.

In order to run:

1. Clone this repository into your local environment and change directories into gitsearch.
2. Add a .env file at the top level of the project (under gitsearch).
3. Inside the .env file add a variable called **REACT_APP_GH='your-github-token'** and place in your personal github token into the quotes
4. Run **npm install** from your terminal window to install the necessary dependencies.
5. Run **npm start** from your terminal window to start the application.
6. Navigate to http://localhost:8080/
7. You should now see the user data for the user name entered in the path populated in the UI.

In order to run the cypress tests:

1. In the terminal run **npm start** if the application is not already running (this will be needed no matter where you want to run the tests)
2. Next run **npx cypress run** to see the command line breakdown of the tests (essentially run them headless)
3. In order to see the browser version of the tests, run **npx cypress open**
4. Wait for the cypress window to open and select **E2E Testing**.
5. Select the **Chrome Browser**, then click **Start E2E Testing in Chrome**.
6. Wait for the Chrome window to open, then select the name of the test file (spec.cy.js)
7. Once there the tests should run automatically with a visual view of what they are doing.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
